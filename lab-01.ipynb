In the case of tabular data, a data set corresponds to one or more database tables, where every **column** of a table represents a particular **variable**, and each **row** corresponds to a given **record of the data** set in question. The data set lists values for each of the variables, such as for example height and weight of an object, for each member of the data set. Data sets can also consist of a collection of documents or files\n",
