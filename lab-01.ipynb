In the case of tabular data, a data set corresponds to one or more database tables, where every **column** of a table represents a particular **variable**, and each **row** corresponds to a given **record of the data** set in question. The data set lists values for each of the variables, such as for example height and weight of an object, for each member of the data set. Data sets can also consist of a collection of documents or files\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Before performing any advanced analysis or modeling, it is essential to explore and understand the underlying structure of the dataset. One fundamental tool for this process is the <code>groupby</code> function in the pandas library, which allows for the aggregation and summarization of data based on one or more categorical features. By grouping data, we can uncover patterns, compare subsets, and derive meaningful insights that would otherwise remain hidden in raw tables. The following exercises are designed to develop familiarity with <code>groupby</code> operations and demonstrate how systematic data exploration leads to a deeper understanding of trends, distributions, and relationships within the data."

    "    - Transformation: Modify the values within each group.\n",

    "​The Titanic disaster highlighted the influence of social class on survival rates. Several factors contributed to this disparity. The ship's design placed first-class accommodations closer to the lifeboats, facilitating quicker access during the evacuation. Additionally, third-class passengers faced physical barriers and lacked clear guidance, which hindered their ability to reach lifeboats in time. These structural and procedural disadvantages underscore how deeply social hierarchies impacted survival outcomes during the tragedy.​"

    "As demonstrated, it is essential to explore data in depth alongside its context, as this approach can uncover meaningful insights into model performance during inference. Understanding the background not only helps interpret results more accurately, but also sheds light on potential biases and patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed. This is particularly crucial when working with historical or real-world datasets, where external factors can significantly influence outcomes."

    "## Handling Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not uncommon in real-world applications for our samples to be missing one or more values for various reasons. There could have been an error in the data collection process, certain measurements are not applicable, or particular fields could have been simply left blank in a survey, for example. We typically see missing values as the blank spaces in our data table or as placeholder strings such as NaN, which stands for not a number, or NULL (a commonly used indicator of unknown values in relational databases).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, most computational tools are unable to handle such missing values, or produce unpredictable results if we simply ignore them. Therefore, it is crucial that we take care of those missing values before we proceed with further analyses. In this section, we will work through several practical techniques for dealing with missing values by removing entries from our dataset or imputing missing values from other samples and features.\n",

    "Often, the removal of samples or dropping of entire feature columns is simply not feasible, because we might lose too much valuable data. In this case, we can use different interpolation techniques to estimate the missing values from the other training samples in our dataset. One of the most common interpolation techniques is **mean imputation**, where we simply replace the missing value with the mean value of the entire feature column. A convenient way to achieve this is by using the [<code>SimpleImputer</code>](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer.html) class from **scikit-learn**, as shown in the following code"
